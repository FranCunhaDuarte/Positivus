# Project: Digital Marketing Agency Website

## Description
This project consists of a website dedicated to a digital marketing agency. The page has been developed with HTML, CSS and JS, in this case I used a widely used library called ScrollReveal, providing a more attractive user experience. The design was created by Olga Skuja, who did an excellent job designing this project, here is the [link](https://www.olgaskuja.design/) to her portfolio.
